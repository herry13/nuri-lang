# OCaml
- Type-checking for action's preconditions and effects.
- Refactor valuation functions (use type-environment to infer the value
  of expression, etc).
- Replace Str regexp with PCRE (or Perl-regexp) library for string pattern
  matching.
- Replace OCaml std-lib with Batteries Included -- although there is no
  changes required in our codes, but we can do refactoring to make them
  better.
- Allow functions in constraints (this also affects action's preconditions).
- Schema/enum in another schema -- when an object inherits a schema, it only
  inherits non-schema and non-enum attributes.

# Portability
- Try to compile in Windows.

# Protobuf
- Compile a schema to protobuf message (*.proto).

# Agent
- The agent receives a Nuri specification through HTTP POST, and then
  compile it locally. The compilation results can be queried with HTTP GET.
- An alternative version can be implemented using ZeroMQ + Protobuf.
